# Run Application
1. Run command in terminal (in your project directory): `npm run build`. This will update anything related to your `App.js` file (so `public/index.html`, any CSS you're pulling in, etc).
2. Run command in terminal (in your project directory): `python3 app.py`
3. Preview web page in browser 'localhost:8080/' (or whichever port you're using)

# Deploy to Heroku
1. Create a Heroku app: `heroku create --buildpack heroku/python`
2. Add nodejs buildpack: `heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs`
3. Push to Heroku: `git push heroku main`
4. Setup variables environment: go to Settings tab at Heroku > Reveal Config Vars

# a. What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
- When doing contact function, we don't know how to connect with Gmail. When we research, we already know how to use EmailJS to connect between our app and Gmail.
- When doing setting function, we change the user's name, it doesn't automatically update immediately. Then, we have to get username from database and pass through userEffect of Setting Page.
- When doing favorite function, we don't know how to save it as an array in a new page. Finally, we saved that array to the database, and when we went to the Favorite Movie page, we loaded all our favorite movies from the database.

# b. What are known problems (still existing), if any, with your project?
- We really have trouble with mock and unmock test.
- I have solved all current problems in Sprint2 based on Proposal. Our team has completed all the functions stated in the proposal.
